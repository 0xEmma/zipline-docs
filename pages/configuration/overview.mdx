# Configuration Overview
Ziplines Configuration file consists of 3 parts:
* [Core](/docs/config/core)
* [Database](/docs/config/database)
* [Uploader](/docs/config/database)

You can view the example config [here](/docs/config/example)

## Error validation
If there is an error or a property's type does not match the schema we have then zipline will error out in a message like:

```log

2021-06-21 09:09:35,375 PM ERROR [config] expected number on core.port, but got string
